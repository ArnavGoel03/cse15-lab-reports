  - Note - The feedback asked me to outline the steps in the installation of VS code but on my computer it literally just took me to run the downloaded file to get it running and hence I didn't have much to add up

For mac user such as myself, there are mutiple ways to install and set up git.
I chose to install it through a package manager for MacOS named HomeBrew.

   - Follow the final intructions promted on the terminal window to finish git set up
  
  
  ### Setting up connection with the remote server
  - Enter the following command onto the terminal window of the VS Code application 
  - `$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
  - You might run into some ambiguous errors as this is the first time setting up. So, if prompted to choose between yes and no for using your passwords, yes is usaully the way to go 
  - Enter the password as the one you chose in the first step
  - A successful login would look something like this -
