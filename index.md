   - Follow the final intructions promted on the terminal window to finish git set up
  
  
  ### Setting up connection with the remote server
  - Enter the following command onto the terminal window of the VS Code application 
  - `$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
  - You might run into some ambiguous errors as this is the first time setting up. So, if prompted to choose between yes and no for using your passwords, yes is usaully the way to go 
  - Enter the password as the one you chose in the first step
  - A successful login would look something like this -
